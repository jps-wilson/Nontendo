# Nontendo
A front-end recreation of a classic Nintendo Game Boy built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project features a fully playable Snake game wrapped in a realistic, pixel-accurate interface, replicating physical buttons, screen styling, and retro animations to blend nostalgic design with interactive game logic.
